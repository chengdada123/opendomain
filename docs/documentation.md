## Overview

**OpenDomain** is an open-source **free subdomain distribution platform**. It allows users to register and self-manage custom subdomains (e.g., `mysite.example.com`) backed by **PowerDNS**. The platform supports paid domains via the NodeLoc payment gateway, a coupon and invitation system, domain health scanning, and CyberPanel web hosting integration.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Go 1.24 · Gin · GORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 |
| Cache | Redis 7 |
| DNS Engine | PowerDNS (REST API) |
| Frontend | Vue 3 · Vue Router · Pinia |
| Authentication | Local (email + password) · GitHub OAuth · Google OAuth · NodeLoc OAuth |
| Payment | NodeLoc Payment Gateway |
| Web Hosting | CyberPanel API |
| Internationalization | Request-level i18n middleware |

## Deployment

## User Levels

The platform uses 5 user levels that affect domain quota and access to premium root domains:

| Level | Name |
|---|---|
| 1 | normal |
| 2 | basic |
| 3 | member |
| 4 | regular |
| 5 | leader |

## Features

### Subdomain Registration

Users select a subdomain prefix and a root domain (e.g., `example.com`), check availability, and complete registration. Root domains can be configured as free or paid and may require a minimum user level.

### DNS Management

Full CRUD support for A, AAAA, CNAME, ALIAS, MX, TXT, NS, SRV, and CAA records. All changes are synced in real time to PowerDNS. DNSSEC is supported, including enable/disable and DS record publishing.

### Payments & Orders

Paid domain registrations are processed via the NodeLoc payment gateway. Coupons support percentage discounts, fixed discounts, and quota increases. Free orders can be completed instantly without entering payment.

### Invitation System

Users can generate invitation codes. When a new user registers using an invitation code, both parties receive a configurable reward (e.g., increased quota or level upgrade).

### Domain Health Scanning

The platform periodically scans all domains for:

- HTTP reachability
- DNS resolution
- SSL certificate validity
- Google Safe Browsing status
- VirusTotal detection

Overall health is reported as `healthy`, `degraded`, or `down`. Domains that remain unhealthy can be automatically suspended.

### Web Hosting (CyberPanel)

Users can request a web hosting account linked to one of their active domains. Hosting accounts are provisioned on CyberPanel servers configured by the administrator.

### Announcements & Custom Pages

Administrators can publish announcements (categories: general, maintenance, update, important) and custom slug-based static pages displayed in the frontend.

# FAQ

**Q: How do I register a domain?**
Search for an available subdomain on the home page. Select a root domain and proceed to checkout. Free domains are activated immediately. Paid domains are activated after payment is completed via NodeLoc.

**Q: What DNS record types are supported?**
A, AAAA, CNAME, ALIAS, MX, TXT, NS, SRV, and CAA — 9 types in total. All changes sync in real time to PowerDNS.

**Q: What does the "DNS not synced" warning mean?**
The DNS records exist in the local database but have not been successfully pushed to PowerDNS. You can trigger a manual sync from the DNS management page.

**Q: Why was my domain suspended?**
Common reasons include:
- Repeated health scan failures (HTTP unreachable, SSL certificate expired, Google Safe Browsing or VirusTotal flags)
- Violation of the platform's terms of use

Click the `suspended` badge on the domain card to view the reason. Contact the administrator to appeal.

**Q: What does the pending deletion warning mean?**
When a domain remains in a failed state beyond the configured grace period, a countdown appears on the domain card. Renew the domain or fix the underlying issue before the timer expires.

**Q: How do I enable DNSSEC?**
Open the domain detail page, navigate to the DNSSEC section, and click Enable. The system will automatically generate keys and publish the DS records to PowerDNS.

**Q: What is an ALIAS record?**
An ALIAS record is a special variant of CNAME that can be used at the zone apex (root domain). PowerDNS resolves the target and returns the resulting IP to the client.

**Q: What coupon types are available?**
- **Percentage discount** — reduces the price by a given percentage
- **Fixed discount** — deducts a fixed amount from the price
- **Quota increase** — increases the number of domains you can register

**Q: How does the invitation reward work?**
When a user registers using your invitation code, both parties receive a reward configured by the administrator (typically a quota increase or level upgrade).

**Q: Can I log in with a third-party account?**
Yes. The login page supports GitHub, Google, and NodeLoc OAuth. The first OAuth login automatically creates an account. You can link or unlink providers from your profile page.

**Q: Is an invitation code required to register?**
It depends on the administrator's configuration. If the platform is running in invite-only mode, a valid invitation code is required to create an account.

**Q: What happens to DNS management when I change nameservers?**
If you update a domain's nameservers to a third-party provider, the platform's DNS management panel will be disabled. Because PowerDNS no longer controls resolution for that domain, record editing is locked until you switch back to the default nameservers.

**Q: How often are domain health scans run?**
Scans are executed by a background worker at a frequency configured by the administrator. Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal integrations are subject to daily API quota limits visible in the admin panel.

# Support

## Contact

If you need assistance, use the following channels:

- **Announcements** — Check the platform announcements page for the latest news and maintenance notices.
- **Administrator** — Contact the platform administrator through the official channel.

## Reporting an Issue

When submitting a report, include the following to help with faster resolution:

1. Your username or registered email address
2. The domain name involved (if applicable)
3. A description of the steps you took
4. Any error messages or screenshots
5. The approximate time the issue occurred

## Self-Service Troubleshooting

### Domain not resolving
1. Verify that DNS records are correctly configured (A/CNAME pointing to the correct IP).
2. Check that the domain status is `active`.
3. Check the DNS sync status — if it shows "not synced", trigger a manual sync on the DNS management page.
4. Allow time for DNS propagation (up to 24–48 hours).

### Unable to log in
1. Confirm your email and password are correct.
2. Try logging in via OAuth (GitHub, Google, or NodeLoc).
3. Clear browser cache and cookies, then try again.

### Payment failed
1. Confirm your NodeLoc account has sufficient balance.
2. Check your network connection and re-initiate the payment.
3. Cancel the existing order and create a new one if needed.

### Domain suspended
1. Click the `suspended` badge on the domain card to view the suspension reason.
2. Resolve the underlying issue (e.g., restore HTTP reachability, renew the SSL certificate).
3. Contact the administrator to request unsuspension.

## Administrator Contact

For account level upgrades, special quota requests, or abuse appeals, contact the administrator through the official platform channel and provide relevant supporting information.
